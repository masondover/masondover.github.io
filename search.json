    "text": "The PGA Tour is halfway through its 2024 season. From January to August, professional golfers from all over the world compete in tournaments throughout the tour. Each tournament takes place at a golf course with a total of 18 holes lasting a couple of days.\nProfessional golfers make money off of their winnings at each tournament. Unlike other professional athletes, PGA golfers do not earn a salary. This creates high stakes on the PGA Tour for professionals to win in order to make money.\nWith a better understanding of the stakes professional golfers compete for, a question is asked. Over the last 5 years, which holes have given the professionals the most trouble on the PGA Tour?\nAny of these holes can make or break a professional’s dream of money and a first-place finish.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nPGA &lt;- read_csv(\"PGAToughestHoles2024 - Sheet1 (1).csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    HoleYear = paste(HOLE,COURSE, YEAR)\n  )\n\nBadPar4 &lt;- PGA |&gt;\n  filter(AVG &gt; 4.3, YARDS &lt; 430) \n\nBadPar5 &lt;- PGA |&gt;\n  filter(AVG &gt; 5.0, YARDS &lt; 550)\n\nBadPar3 &lt;- PGA |&gt;\n  filter(AVG &gt; 3.5, YARDS &lt; 230)\n\nBadP4 &lt;- PGA |&gt;\n  filter(AVG &gt; 4.6, YARDS &lt; 500)\n\nBad &lt;- bind_rows(BadPar4,BadPar5,BadPar3, BadP4)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=PGA, aes(x=YARDS, y=AVG), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=PGA, aes(x=YARDS, y=AVG), method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_point(data=Bad, aes(x=YARDS, y=AVG), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Bad, aes(x=YARDS, y=AVG, label=HoleYear)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Yards\", \n    y=\"Average Score\", \n    title=\"Scorecards Turn Ugly\", \n    subtitle=\"Over the last 5 years, dreams die when professional golfers play these holes.\",\n    caption=\"Source: PGATour.com | By Mason Dover\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGolfers did not score well on any of these holes. Hole 18 at The Renaissance Club in 2022 became a burden at the tour. Golfers shot almost a full stroke over par at this hole, making it the hardest hole in the 2022 PGA Tour.\nDistance plays a role in a hole’s difficulty, but what do those results look like?\nEvery par puts expectations on the professionals. To win a tournament, golfers need to score low on each hole.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nPGA &lt;- read_csv(\"PGAToughestHoles2024 - Sheet1 (1).csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    HoleYear = paste(HOLE,COURSE, YEAR), \n    Difficulty = AVG - PAR...4\n  )\n\ntop20 &lt;- PGA |&gt; top_n(20, wt=Difficulty)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(data=top20, aes(y=reorder(HoleYear, DBLBOGEY), x=BIRDIE, xend=DBLBOGEY),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"The Top 20 Holes Based on the Difference Between the Scoring Average on the Hole and Par\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;birdies&lt;/span&gt; are on the left, that's good.

Some holes, like Oak Hill Country Club’s East Course Hole 6 in 2023, have many birdies and double bogeys in the results.\nGolfers struggled on Hole 18 of The Renaissance Club in 2022. Players were unable to score many birdies and ended up shooting a lot more double bogeys. \nNow that distance and score have been determined as factors in difficulty, how can golfers decide which holes are the hardest? \nThe location of every hole and the expected par increases the stakes, which can make things difficult as the game goes on.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nPGA &lt;- read_csv(\"PGAToughestHoles2024 - Sheet1 (1).csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    HoleYear = paste(HOLE,COURSE, YEAR), \n    Difficulty = AVG - PAR...4\n  )\n\ntop10 &lt;- PGA |&gt; top_n(10, wt=Difficulty)\n\nHardTop10 &lt;- top10 |&gt;\n  select(HoleYear, PAR...4, AVG, Difficulty)\n\nHardTop10 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n    cols_label(\n    HoleYear = \"PGA Courses\",\n    PAR...4 = \"Par\",\n    AVG = \"Avg\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Challenges in the Back Half\",\n    subtitle = \"Par 4's provide the most difficulty to professional golfers, but a couple par 3's sneak their way into the top 10.\" \n  ) |&gt;\ntab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Mason Dover  |  **Source:** PGATour.com\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=15)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(Difficulty),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#98FB98\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = HoleYear == \"17 Ocean Course at Kiawah Island 2021\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#98FB98\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = HoleYear == \"16 Muirfield Village Golf Course 2020\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Back Half\n\n\nPar 4's provide the most difficulty to professional golfers, but a couple par 3's sneak their way into the top 10.\n\n\nPGA Courses\nPar\nAvg\nDifficulty\n\n\n\n\n6 Oak Hill Country Club - East Course 2023\n4\n4.519\n51.9%\n\n\n18 The Renaissance Club 2022\n4\n4.617\n61.7%\n\n\n18 TPC Sawgrass 2022\n4\n4.530\n53.0%\n\n\n11 TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm 2022\n4\n4.489\n48.9%\n\n\n11 Augusta National Golf Club 2022\n4\n4.477\n47.7%\n\n\n17 St. Andrews Links (Old Course) 2022\n4\n4.456\n45.6%\n\n\n17 Ocean Course at Kiawah Island 2021\n3\n3.531\n53.1%\n\n\n18 Bay Hill Club & Lodge 2021\n4\n4.464\n46.4%\n\n\n18 Quail Hollow Club 2021\n4\n4.456\n45.6%\n\n\n18 GC of Houston 2020\n4\n4.501\n50.1%\n\n\n16 Muirfield Village Golf Course 2020\n3\n3.468\n46.8%\n\n\n\nBy: Mason Dover | Source: PGATour.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some may expect par 5’s to challenge professionals the most, it is the opposite.\nWith fewer strokes to work with, professionals need to make every shot count. Each hole’s distance also plays a big factor in which club a golfer needs to use. That explains hole 17 at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island in 2021 and hole 16 at Muirfield Village Golf Course in 2020’s difficulty.\nEach professional golfer faces adversity on the golf course. There are many challenges on each hole that make or break players. The weather, sand traps and mental pressure are just a few. \nIn the next 5 years, these factors will determine which holes cause the most trouble on the PGA Tour."

    "text": "After the Cleveland Cavaliers swept the Toronto Raptors in the second round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs, something needed to change. On July 18, 2018, the Raptors traded DeMar DeRozen, Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.\nToronto traded away their best player, DeMar DeRozen, and took a chance on Kawhi. Leonard sustained a right quadriceps injury the season prior, limiting him to 9 total games.\nThe injury did not hold Kawhi back and the Toronto Raptors had another great year. The Raptors overcame a second round exit and ended up winning their first NBA Championship.\nEven though Kawhi only spent one year with the Raptors, how much of an impact did he have on the Toronto Raptors?\nNBA Regular Season games determine which teams qualify for the Playoffs. Coming off of an amazing career with the Spurs, Kawhi needed to show the Raptors what he could do.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nNBATeams &lt;- read_csv(\"NBAData - NBATeamFinish.csv\")\n\nSpurs &lt;- NBATeams |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"San Antonio Spurs\") |&gt;\n  filter(Season == \"2011-12\" | Season == \"2012-13\" | Season == \"2013-14\" | Season == \"2014-15\" | Season == \"2015-16\" | Season == \"2016-17\" | Season == \"2017-18\")\n\nRaptors &lt;- NBATeams |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Toronto Raptors\") |&gt;\n  filter(Season == \"2018-19\")\n\nClippers &lt;- NBATeams |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Clippers\") |&gt;\n  filter(Season == \"2019-20\" | Season == \"2020-21\" | Season == \"2021-22\" | Season == \"2022-23\" | Season == \"2023-24\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=NBATeams, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, group=Team), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=NBATeams, aes(x=Season, y=Rk), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 4) +\n  geom_bump(data=Spurs, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, group=Team), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=Spurs, aes(x=Season, y=Rk), color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data=Raptors, aes(x=Season, y=Rk), color = \"#CE1141\", size = 4) +\n  geom_bump(data=Clippers, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, group=Team), color=\"#1D428A\") +\n  geom_point(data=Clippers, aes(x=Season, y=Rk), color = \"#1D428A\", size = 4) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  labs(title=\"Kawhi's Journey in the Top Ranks\", \n       subtitle=\"Leonard continues to help the &lt;span style = 'color:black;'&gt;Spurs&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style = 'color:#CE1141;'&gt;Raptors&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:#1D428A;'&gt;Clippers&lt;/span&gt; finish strong in the NBA's Regular Season.\",\n       y= \"Rank\", \n       x = \"Season\",\n       caption=\"Source: Basketball-Reference.com | By Mason Dover\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToronto’s trade worked out! The Raptors finished second overall in the NBA. Leonard came into Toronto ready to win and succeeded.\nIn any basketball game, the offense and defense determine a win or loss. Since Kawhi has won a lot, how has he performed in the offense?\nThe Raptors traded away their leading scorer for Leonard. Toronto needed Kawhi to fill in the role and lead them to a championship.\n\n\nCode\nKawhiCareer &lt;- read_csv(\"KawhiData - KawhiPlayerStats.csv\")\nKawhiTeams &lt;- read_csv(\"KawhiData - KawhiTeams.csv\")\n\nKawhiSpecificTeams &lt;- KawhiTeams |&gt;\n  filter(PRESENT == \"YES\") |&gt;\n  select(Season, Tm, PTS) |&gt;\n  rename(\n    TeamPts = PTS\n  )\n\nKawhiBarTeams &lt;-KawhiCareer |&gt;\n  inner_join(KawhiSpecificTeams) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(TeamSeason, TeamPts, PTS) |&gt;\n  rename(\n    Pts = PTS\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=ends_with(\"Pts\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Pts\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=KawhiBarTeams, aes(x=reorder(TeamSeason, Pts), weight=Pts, fill=Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"lightgrey\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Leonard Finds Rhythm\", \n       subtitle=\"Kawhi becomes a dual threat when his offensive efficiency improved with the Toronto Raptors.\", \n       y= \"Total Points\", \n       x = \"\",\n       caption=\"Source: Basketball-Reference.com | By Mason Dover\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, Kawhi’s season with the Toronto Raptors was the most offensively efficient team in his career. Toronto scored 9,384 points that year, which is the most points scored in any Raptors season. Kawhi contributed 1,596 points to the franchise record.\nKawhi led the Raptors in scoring that year with an average of 26.6 points. Almost averaging 10 total points over the next player, Pascal Siakam, Leonard was a big asset on offense for the Raptors.\nNow that Kawhi’s offensive skills have been determined, how was his defense with the Raptors?\nKawhi came into the Raptors with amazing defensive skills from the Spurs.
